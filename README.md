# UFOs
# Overview
For this project, we developed a webpage containing data of UFO sightings, using Javascript. We then also used HTML and Boostrual to be able to style the webpage using a dark background, white lettering font, and a jpeg image on the jumbotron, utilizing CSS. 

# Results 
The webpage was developed to display UFO sightings using data stored in the Javascript file, data.js. The webpage was developed together with HTML to organizr the data into a tabnle and enable filters, such as the dates of the sighting, the city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO sighting. I have provided two images from the Webpage, showing the an explation of the UFO sightings in Fig 1 and the data table, along with the filters in Fig 2.

# Summary 
One drawback of the webpage is the difficulty for the user to know what category to use for the filtering. For example, if you want to pick a city or state, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis. 
Two additional recommendations for further development I would suggest: 1)You could have a clickable part of each UFO sighting entry that redirects you to a search on the topic or another webpage with more information, 2) Include a reset filters button titled "clear table". Even though the instructions for this project didn't require this, I included it to the webapge by refactoring the code from the Filter Table button in the index.html file.
